// Integration Testing:

// Test the end-to-end flow of user authentication, problem management, and code submission.
// 7. Deployment
// Deployment Setup:

// Hosting: Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, AWS).
// CI/CD: Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
// Monitoring and Maintenance:
